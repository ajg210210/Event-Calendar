# Creative Portion
For the creative portion, we are adding tags that allow users to assign high or low priority to events. High priority events are represented by red text and low priority is shown by green text. The priority is optional, so if the user decides to not select a priority, the text stays black. 
The next thing we did was add the current day noted on the calender (it says "today"). This updates whenever the page is reloaded and can work for any date in the future.
The last thing we did was add a feature where a user could send one of their events to another user. You type in the username of the person you want to send to.
