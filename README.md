Event-Calendar


I built a website that functions as a monthly calendar that users can dynamically add events to. The website by default shows the current month, and can show future and previous months. Users can login to see their events on the calendar, and can add new ones, inputting the date, time and priority (optional). High priority events are represented by red text and low priority is shown by green text. The current date is highlighted in red. Deleting and editing events on the calendar is supported. Users can also add events on another user's calendar, which would show up when they login into the website (and shows who sent them the event). 

I used JavaScript, AJAX, PHP and HTML to build the website, and stored user logins (with encrypted passwords) and events in a MySQL database. The website is run through an AWS EC2
